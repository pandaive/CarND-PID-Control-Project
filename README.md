## PID controller - effects of P, I and D components

**P** component is the most important, as it directly affects the behavior based on error value. In this case, the biggest P parameter, the harder the car is turning to the center position when outside.

**I** component is a bias adjusting parameter. It is used, when some general bias is assumed to affect the motion of the car. In this case, we may assume that the bias is very little - or none at all.

**D** component is supposed to smooth the line of P component - it means it reduces the overshooting and oscilating of P component.

In case of this project, it is easily visible when one of the components is overrated. When P is set too big, the car is turning aggresively - in real life causing passenger to have dizziness :) Too much of I component causes car to behave completely unexpectedly - it tends to correct itself to one way, loosing the path in very first seconds of the road. Behavior of a controller with overrated D component might be a surprise - though it is supposed to protect the car from oscillating, it causes exactly that when too much - it means it tries so hard not to overshoot, that it's spinning around the center, causing a lot of small radius oscillations.

In addition to PID controller for a steering behavior, I also implelemented this controller for a throttle value. As it can be seen in the code, it is dependent on CTE value and its speed compared to the angle - so the car will slow down when the error is big, but also when it drives fast and it goes into a curve - safety reasons :)

The final choice of parameters is purely experimental and manual. I tried to choose completely different values to finally end up with those provided in main.cpp file (lines 36-45). During the process I was able to see the dependencies of the values that I described above.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
